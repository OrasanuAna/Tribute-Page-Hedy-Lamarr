            Hedy Lamarr was an Austrian-American actress and inventor who is
            known for her beauty, talent, and groundbreaking work in technology.
            Born in 1914 in Vienna, Lamarr became a prominent Hollywood actress
            during the Golden Age of cinema, starring in films such as
            <i>Algiers</i> (1938) and <i>Sampson and Delilah</i> (1949).
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond her acting career, Lamarr made significant contributions to
            science and technology. During World War II, she co-invented a
            frequency-hopping communication system intended to guide torpedoes
            without being intercepted, which laid the foundation for modern
            wireless technologies such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. In recognition of
            her pioneering work, Lamarr was posthumously inducted into the
            National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2014.

        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
          Hedy Lamarr was born as Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler on November 9, 1914,
          in Vienna, Austria. Her father was a successful banker, and her mother
          was a pianist. Hedy showed an early interest in acting and the arts,
          and she was also fascinated by technology and machinery.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the age of 16, Hedy had already landed her first major role in the
          controversial film <i>Ecstasy</i> (1933), which caught the attention
          of the international film industry. However, her true passion for
          science remained a constant throughout her life, even as she entered
          the glamorous world of Hollywood.

        <h2>Hollywood Career</h2>
        <p>
          Hedy Lamarr’s rise to fame began with her role in the 1938 film
          <i>Algiers</i>, which established her as a leading lady in Hollywood.
          Over the next decade, she starred in numerous films alongside major
          stars of the time, such as Clark Gable and Victor Mature. Some of her
          most notable works include <i>Sampson and Delilah</i> (1949) and
          <i>The Heavenly Body</i> (1944).
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite her success on the screen, Lamarr became increasingly
          frustrated with the lack of control over her career, feeling typecast
          as a glamorous starlet rather than being recognized for her intellect.

      <!-- Invention and Legacy Section -->
      <section id="invention">
        <h2>Invention & Legacy</h2>
        <p>
          During World War II, Lamarr teamed up with composer George Antheil to
          develop a frequency-hopping spread spectrum technology. Their
          invention was designed to prevent the interception of radio-controlled
          torpedoes by allowing the signals to hop between frequencies, making
          it difficult for enemies to jam or intercept them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the U.S. Navy did not adopt the technology during the war,
          Lamarr and Antheil’s work laid the foundation for modern wireless
          communications. Today, their invention is considered a precursor to
          technologies like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GPS.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1997, Lamarr was awarded the Electronic Frontier Foundation Pioneer
          Award, and in 2014, she was posthumously inducted into the National
          Inventors Hall of Fame, solidifying her place in history as both a
          Hollywood icon and a scientific innovator.
